The tevs directory contains TEVS "Python" files which I have written.  Jimmy 
Frasche is in the process of doing a substantial rewrite.  

The PILB directory contains the files which make up the 
Python Imaging Library, version x.xx, together with extensions 
to that library.  PILB will no removed in the future, replaced
with extensions which make use of PIL's Image structure without 
requiring an extended PIL.

TEVS is largely glue between other existing open source programs, 
which are also installed on the custom DVD in which this directory is located.

TEVS runs on the Ubuntu Linux operating system, uses the Tesseract optical 
character recognition program, and is written in the open source language
Python.  Data files written by TEVS may be opened in spreadsheeet and
database programs, and this DVD includes the Open Office spreadsheet 
application and the PostgreSQL database.

User documentation for TEVS is in the files whose names begin userguide.

Programmer documentation for TEVS is in the files whose names begin devguide.

This version of TEVS operates on Hart Intercivic ballots, but is designed
to be easily extended to ballots generated by other vendors.
